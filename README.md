# MiniRobotBrain
MiniRobotBrain is a simple text-based robot simulator built in Python. It understands basic commands like move, turn, and report position, and responds logically like a real robot’s brain. The goal is to simulate how a robot thinks and decides actions using simple programming logic — no graphics, just pure reasoning.
